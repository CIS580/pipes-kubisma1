      Your goal is to connect starting (S) and ending (E) pipe using pipes
      that are being randomly generated and are visible in the right panel before
      flooding starts. In the first level, the flooding begins after 1 minute.
      Advancing level decreases the timer by 4.5 seconds and also speeds up water
      flow. Use your left mouse button to place a pipe, right mouse button to
      rotate it. Can you make it?
